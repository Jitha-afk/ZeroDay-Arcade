# Cyber War Game Simulation Platform - Product Requirements Document

---

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the product requirements for the **Cyber War Game Simulation Platform**, a web-based multiplayer simulation tool designed to emulate real-world cyber crisis situations in a gamified format. The PRD serves as a central reference for stakeholders, developers, and designers, ensuring clarity on goals, features, and technical specifications. It will guide the project from initial development through launch and future enhancements.

## 2. Product overview

The Cyber War Game Simulation Platform enables corporate teams to participate in a **215-minute simulated breach scenario**. Players assume critical enterprise roles such as **CISO, PR Head, Legal Head, SOC Lead, SOC Analyst, and IT Head**. Only one participant logs in to play; other roles can be simulated by AI.

Scenarios are driven by **JSON input files**, defining events, alerts, decisions, and communications. Throughout the simulation, users experience escalating challenges, make decisions, and collaborate across roles. The platform concludes with a **debrief report**, emphasizing lessons learned and how the **Microsoft Security Stack** could mitigate threats.
